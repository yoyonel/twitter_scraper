# Introduction to Tweet JSON: Tweet objects

> All Twitter APIs that return Tweets provide that data encoded using JavaScript 
Object Notation (JSON). JSON is based on key-value pairs, with named attributes and associated values. These attributes, and their state are used to describe objects.
At Twitter we serve many objects as JSON, including Tweets and Users. These objects all encapsulate core attributes that describe the object. Each Tweet has an author, a message, a unique ID, a timestamp of when it was posted, and sometimes geo metadata shared by the user. Each User has a Twitter name, an ID, a number of followers, and most often an account bio.

> With each Tweet we also generate "entity" objects, which are arrays of common Tweet 
contents such as hashtags, mentions, media, and links. If there are links, the JSON payload can also provide metadata such as the fully unwound URL and the webpage’s title and description.

> Consumers of Tweets should tolerate the addition of new fields and variance in 
ordering of fields with ease. Not all fields appear in all contexts. It is generally safe to consider a nulled field, an empty set, and the absence of a field as the same thing. Please note that Tweets found in Search results vary somewhat in structure from this document.
